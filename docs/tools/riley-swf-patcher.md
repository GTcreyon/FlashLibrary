## Usage

To use the tool, download `apply-patch.py`. Once you've done this, you will need to edit the `JPEXS_PATH` and `JPEXS_ARGS` variables to make the patcher run on your system.

You should then run `./apply-patch.py [input SWF] [patch folder] [patch stage file] [output SWF]` on the command line to run the patcher.
