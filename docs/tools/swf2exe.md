# Swf2Exe

**Swf2Exe** is a tool that can be used to convert [SWF files](../info/swf.md) into [standalone projector bundle](../info/bundle.md) EXE files for easier access. 

!!! note
	These EXE files are native to Windows. There is no official equivalent for other platforms.

## Usage

To use the tool, extract the ZIP file to any folder of your choice and then open the Swf2Exe executable. Press the "Clear Input" button to remove the placeholder SWF then press the "Add a File" button and select the desired SWF.

Once you have added your SWF file, press convert, and the tool will convert the SWF to an EXE and place it in the Output folder that can be found in the same directory. 

!!! note "Tip:"
	Optionally, you can place a custom [projector](../players/projector.md) in the Lib folder replacing "SA.exe" to have the bundle use that projector instead of the default version 32 provided.
