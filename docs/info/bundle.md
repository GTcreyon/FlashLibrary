# Executable bundles

Executable bundles, also referred to as projector bundles or simply projectors are files that contain both a [SWF file](swf.md) and a [standalone projector](../players/projector.md). When executed, the SWF file will automatically be run within the included projector. This creates a portable file that can be run without the need to download a standalone projector.
