# Executable bundles

**Executable bundles** (also known as **projector bundles** or simply **projectors**) are `.exe` files that contain both a [SWF file](swf.md) and a [standalone projector](../players/projector.md). This forms a portable file that can be run without the need to download a standalone projector. When executed, the SWF file will automatically be run within the included projector.
