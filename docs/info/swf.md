# SWF file

An **SWF file** (also referred to as **ShockWave Flash file** or Small Web Format file) is a file that contains Flash Player content, such as games or animations. It can be played using the [official projectors](../players/projector.md), or any other alternative player. Previously, SWF files could be played using the Flash Player plugin, [but this is now non-functional](eol.md).
