SM63 comes in two versions:

- The 2009 version, which is recommended for playing through the story as it lacks some of the bugs found in the 2012 version.

- The 2012 version, which is recommended for the level designer, as it contains many more items and tiles than the former 2009 version. Furthermore, it has a directly accessible level portal allowing players to play levels very quickly.
