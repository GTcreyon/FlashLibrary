Ruffle is a flash emulator written in the Rust programming language. Ruffle can be used in the browser through the Ruffle [demo](https://ruffle.rs/demo/) by selecting an SWF file from your local files, or it can also be added to your personal website.

All of this information and more can be accessed on the official [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) website.
